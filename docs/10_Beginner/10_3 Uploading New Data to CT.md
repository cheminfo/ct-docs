## **10-3 Uploading New Data to CT**

* At least two things are needed to create a new case in CT: a chemical structure and an NMR spectrum. Data is uploaded in the CT Data Manager  
* Click on the icon “data and import manager” to enter the server page and upload files: drag and drop in the hole, or click on the upload icon (circled in red)

1. Upload the processed NMR experimental spectra as .jdx file  
   1. When uploading, CT will identify the solvent used, just confirm, and the spin system will be included for this case  
      **Note:** Benzene-d6 is not on the solvent list.  
   2. The pH is another possible input, if ignored ND (not determined) is the automatic one  
   3. Suppression: a suppression region is automatically set for the identified solvent, the delimitation can be adjusted (change input numbers), the region can be removed (-) or more can be added (+) \[**note**: this can be done also from the analysis window or from the spectrum window, add/remove region of interests (ROIs)\]

2. Chemical structure in 2D or 3D (“.mol” or “.sdf” file), both file types can be downloaded from ChemSpider or PubChem. Another possibility is to draw the chemical structure in ChemDraw. InChI or SMILES are also supported.  
   1. Remember that implicit hydrogens and stereochemistry information are relevant for the analysis because this file will constitute the spin system of the molecule.  
      1. It is preferred to use the 3D structure and optimize the structure by minimizing the energy to get the most stable conformation.  
   2. To include the structure, drag and drop them in the hole or click on the second icon (circled in green).

3. When all the files are uploaded, the screen will look like this: the spectrum is indicated with the spectrum icon (first object in the list), the spin systems with the spin icon (last three object of the list)  
     
4. The spin system or the spectrum can be opened with the “eye” icon. This works in all the sections in which the “eye” is present: New Analysis Data window, the Analysis Dashboard or “Home page”, Data Manager & Import or “Server page”. Only in the last two windows mentioned it is possible to find also the “pencil” icon to edit.Sp  
   1. For the spin system, it displays the structure of the molecule (2D and 3D), the predicted spectrum, the predicted chemical shifts and coupling constants. It can be edited manually using the “pencil” icon.  
   2. The experimental spectrum can also be viewed with the “eye” icon. It can be edited as well manually using the “pencil” icon.

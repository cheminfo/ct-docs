## **10-2 Prepare NMR Spectra**

* The processing of NMR spectra has to be done outside of CT  
* [nmrium.org](http://nmrium.org) is a great tool for this purpose; any other NMR processing software that can export JDX files can also be used  
* Apply usual processing to your spectra: window function (moderate Lorentzian-Gaussian), correction of phase, baseline correction, chemical shift reference  
* Export each spectrum as “JCAMP-DX” file (extension “.jdx” or “.dx”)

# **CTUG | Background Information**

# **The CT User Group**

This group was formed in 2025 to organize and support the collection and dissemination of guidance, tips and tricks, and other useful information about the Cosmi Truth (CT) software tool for quantum mechanical spin analysis (QMSA) of NMR spectra.
We are eager to use GIThub more and fix errors.

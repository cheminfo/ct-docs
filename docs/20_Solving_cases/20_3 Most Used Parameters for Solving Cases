When solving suboptimal cases, the focus is typically on improving the intensity and RMS scores, and thereby the matching score, by making the following adjustments:

*delta*:


move nuclei to the correct position based on known or suspected assignments; swapping A/B pairs in terms of their delta values

*J*:


checking J patterns for errors; correcting J values that are known or for which a range can be safely assumed; swapping A/B pairs in terms of their coupling patterns

*Line width and shape*:

make known assignments and/or set reasonably safe values and ranges for line width and Lorentzian/Gaussian line shape

*Response*:

make known assignments and/or set reasonably safe values and ranges for the response
